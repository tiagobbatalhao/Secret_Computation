Secret_Computation
==================

Single-run classical computation guaranteed by quantum mechanics

Alice wants to run a program on an input of her choosing.
However, she does not know an algorithm for this program.

Bob knows an algorithm, but does not want to reveal it to Alice (nor to anyone else).

Bob wants Alice to be able to run the program only once, for only one choice of input.

Bob wants Alice to be unable to do reverse engineering, even if she is dishonest and tries to obtain the algorithm.

Alice does not want to reveal her input to Bob.
